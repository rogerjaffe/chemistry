<h3>Download R and S</h3>
This is the page for downloading the zip file containing the top page and the 
150+ structures for the organic fragments practice page. The procedure is very straighforward, but first a couple
of quick notes. Like everything else on this site, the materials are provided
freely and without restrictions beyond not charging for access. Bug reports are
welcomed. Anyone wanting to augment/modify the structure bank should contact me
directly and I'll give you the protocols so that the added structures will be properly
read by the answer routine. To install the files, just unzip the zip file into whatever
directory you want. Then point your browser at the top file "butyls.html" which will be
the only html file in the zip file. <br>
