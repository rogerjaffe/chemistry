<h2>Electronic Homework System</h2>
July 13, 1998<br>
<br>
This is a brief intro to the electronic homework system which is in its final shakedown before it will be made freely available across the web. I expect there to be about one more week of working out the kinks. To provide myself with some working margin, I am setting <b>August 1</b> as the formal deadline. The system to be distributed has been used at CSUDH very successfully for the past two years and will be made available in two forms. For those who would like to install it on their own servers, we will provide all of the source code for the web pages, the supporting  graphic files, the cgi scripts, and instructions needed for a complete local install on a Unix/Linux system. In addition we will provide, hopefully, adequate instructions as well was page templates which can be used for your developing your own pages for addition to the system. The same setup should work on  Windows NT based platforms, with some modifications. For those who don't wish to or can't do local installations, we will provide accounts and space on our systems for your use. There will be no charge to any educational user for any of this material. This work is open to all educators, regardless of level. It is not limited to university faculty. In addition to the homework systems, we are in the final stages of updating the lecture help pages which complement the homework system and which will also be made freely available on about August 1. Below I have provided a link to the "work in progress" homework site and to the existing Lecture Help site. Both the Homework Pages and the new Lecture Help pages will be compatible with the current versions (3.x and 4.x) of Netscape and Internet Explorer. The Lecture Help pages run as a standalone free of any server need, so they can be installed by a student on a computer without need of a WWW connection. There is an email link below. I would greatly appreciate hearing from anyone who is interested in this, as it will help me properly gauge my resource needs. General inquiries are also welcomed. I would also appreciate anyone who knows others who might be interested in this material bring it to their attention. <br>
